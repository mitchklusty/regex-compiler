Fixed issues from the parser part 1:
    Solved multipletails.re
    I believe my numeric fail handling works, but the test file is empty. I am assuming the numeric fail is like "/ 123 /"

Run `make` to build the project
Run `make test` to test against my selected test cases
Run `make clean` to remove intermediate build files
